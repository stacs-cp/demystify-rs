Some variable names are special-cased, to draw puzzles. One important thing is that it must be possible from the variables to deduce the size of the problem:


* fixed : Values which are pre-set. This is also used to deduce the size of the grid
* width : width of the grid
* height : height of the grid
* grid_size : width + height of a square grid (can't be the more obvious 'size', as that is a keyword in Essence)
